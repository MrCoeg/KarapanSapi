## My Work

### Programming
My role in the development of the game, themed around traditional Indonesian buffalo racing ("Karapan Sapi"), involved comprehensive programming tasks, leveraging Unity's robust capabilities:

- **Game Mechanics**: Engineered the core racing mechanics, allowing for dynamic obstacle interactions and competitive AI-controlled opponents. Implemented features such as speed boosts, variable racer stamina, and collision effects tailored to mimic the intensity and strategy of buffalo racing.
- **Character and Item Systems**: Developed a system for managing characters and items using Unity's Scriptable Objects. This approach enabled efficient management of different character stats, upgrade paths, and item effects (both offensive and buffs), ensuring that game data remains flexible and easily configurable.
- **Economy System**: Programmed an in-game currency system, which players use to purchase new characters and items. The system is integrated with game progression, rewarding players with currency for race performance, unlocking new maps, and achieving specific milestones.

### Responsive UI Approach
I designed and implemented a UI that enhances player interaction and provides seamless navigation across various scenes including the main menu, settings, map selection, and gameplay:

- **Dynamic UI Elements**: Created adaptive UI elements that respond to game state changes and player interactions, such as updating character stats, item availability, and race results in real-time.
- **Scene Management**: Utilized Unity's scene management to ensure smooth transitions between different game scenes while maintaining state consistency across the UI, including options and player settings.

### Game Architecture
Focused on creating a scalable and maintainable architecture, my contributions ensured that game features could be updated and expanded efficiently:

- **Scriptable Object Utilization**: Leveraged Scriptable Objects for managing not only character and item data but also inter-scene communication. This method proved essential for maintaining a clean and modular codebase, facilitating easier updates and scalability.
- **Audio Management**: Implemented a dynamic audio management system where each character could have unique background music that enhances their individuality and the overall game atmosphere. This system integrates seamlessly with the game's state management to provide contextual audio cues.
- **Data Persistence**: Designed a robust data persistence system to save player progress, including unlocked characters, items, and maps. This system uses serialization to store data locally, ensuring players can resume their progress seamlessly.
